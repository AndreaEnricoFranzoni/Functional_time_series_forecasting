**Test on surfaces FTS**

-   *Artificial_data*: forecasting of synthetically generated surface FTS. Comparison between PPC and EK (estimated kernel), EKI (estimated kernel improved), MP (mean), NP (naive) and EX (exact) predictors. Analysis of PPC parameters

-   *RealWorld_data*: forecasting of Black Sea sea level. Forecasting of original time serie, one differentiation time serie, two differentiations time serie. Comparison between PPC and EK (estimated kernel), EKI (estimated kernel improved), MP (mean), NP (naive) and a CC (concurrent) predictors. Analysis of PPC parameters, comparison between PPC cv both parameters and PPC cv on $\alpha$ and explanatory power criterion for k, for all the three time series
