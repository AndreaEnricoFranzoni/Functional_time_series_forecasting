# **Test on curves FTS**

-   `Artificial_data`: forecasting of synthetically generated curve FTS. Comparison between PPC and EK (estimated kernel), EKI (estimated kernel improved), MP (mean), NP (naive) and EX (exact) predictors. Analysis of PPC parameters, validation errors cv on alpha dynamic

-   `RealWorld_data`: forecasting of gas prices, in function of their quantity. Offer and demand curves. Comparison between PPC and EK (estimated kernel), EKI (estimated kernel improved), MP (mean), NP (naive) and a CC (concurrent) predictors. Analysis of PPC parameters, prediction of the next instant to analyze PPC
